# The Body in the Dorm Party - Interactive Film
## Project for Communications Lab, Fall 2020

The Body in the Dorm Party is an interactive mystery that reveals Detective Kobenova’s murder investigation at an illegal dorm party. The storyline revolves around three main characters--the “suspects”--a student majoring in economics, a student majoring in theater arts, and another student majoring in history. 

Overall theme of the film is dramatic, yet it deploys some elements of comedy — we wanted to tell a story about the atypical life of students at New York University in Abu Dhabi. The aesthetic of the film was inspired by the mystery movies from the last century, using black-and-white effects, funny costumes, and dramatic actors. 

Hosted on the web, the project consists of six videos: three interviews with suspects and three evidence pieces being collected by the detective. The videos are presented out of order, and it is the user’s task to establish the right timeline and reveal the mystery on the last page of the website.

The landing page of the website — https://mjvar.github.io/body-at-the-dorm-party/ — starts with an interactive p5.js sketch of a person holding a bloody bottle. When the button is clicked, the user is redirected to the evidence board, in which they can view all of the suspect interviews and evidence videos. After the videos are watched, the user can go ahead onto the next page to solve the mystery — this page was made with the help of jQuery to allow more meaningful interaction. 

A few challenges that our team has faced during the making of this project is film and sound editing. The primary task was to cut all of the scenes to fit the six-minute limit and at the same time convey the same storytelling effect. To make the video cuts more powerful, we decided to add some music and broken television effects between the cuts. After a few sound edits in Logic Pro X and video edits in Windows Movie Maker and Adobe Premiere Pro, the final version of the film was ready.
